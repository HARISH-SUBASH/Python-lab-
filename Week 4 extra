1. Write a program to check whether a given number is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive number which sum of all positive divisors excluding that number is equal to that number. For example, 6 is a perfect number since the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. Sum of its divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
# perfect number
n = int(input())
c = 0
for i in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        c += i
if c == n:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

2. Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n.
# sum
def sum(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n + sum(n - 1)

n = int(input())
c = sum(n)
print("The sum of the first ", n, " positive integers is ", c, '.0', sep='')

3. A strong number is a special number whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number. For example, 145 is a strong number. Since, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145.
# strong number
import math

def strong(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return math.factorial(n % 10) + strong(n // 10)

n = int(input())
c = strong(n)
if c == n:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

4. Rakesh loves playing with numbers. He took the Fibonacci series and wants to find the sum of squares of the series until a given value. Write a code that implements his task.
# fibonacci
def fiba(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fiba(n - 1) + fiba(n - 2)

n = int(input())
d = 0

for i in range(1, n + 2):
         c = fiba(i)
          d = d + (c * c)
    print(d)

5. A number is stable if each digit occurs the same number of times, i.e., the frequency of each digit in the number is the same. For example, 2277, 4004, 11, 23, 538835, 1010 are examples of stable numbers. Similarly, a number is unstable if the frequency of each digit in the number is NOT the same.
# stable
n = int(input())
s = str(n)
l = len(list(set(s)))
f = list()
for i in set(s):
    f.append(s.count(i))

if f.count(f[0]) == l:
    print("Stable Number")
else:
    print("Unstable Number")
